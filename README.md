# Editor Waveform
Shows the current song's waveform in the editor

## Notes
 - [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/sE_xLYuiZm8)
 - re-enter the editor if you change the song to update the waveform
 - if the waveform looks not synced to the actual music when playtesting, use speedhack or increase the music offset on the last page of *global (not level)* options until it syncs
